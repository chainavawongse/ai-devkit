# Configuring Project Management

Configure project management tool integration, verify MCP server installation and authentication, and record project metadata in repository documentation.

**Core principle:** MCP servers are user-installed dependencies. This skill verifies they exist and work correctly, but NEVER attempts to install them.

**Purpose:** Enable plugin workflows to create, update, and track tickets automatically through JIRA integration.

## When to Use

**Use this skill when:**

- Setting up new repository with the plugin
- Configuring project management integration for first time
- Verifying MCP server installation and authentication
- Recording project/epic metadata for ticket creation

**Don't use when:**

- Project management already configured and verified
- Repository uses no PM tool (manual tracking only)
- MCP integration not needed

## Prerequisites

**User must have MCP server installed separately:**

- **JIRA**: <https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-rovo-mcp-server/docs/setting-up-claude-ai/>
- **JIRA**: User must find and install appropriate JIRA MCP server
- **GitHub Issues**: Built-in via GitHub CLI (gh) - no MCP server needed

**CRITICAL:** plugin does NOT install MCP servers. User installs them separately.

## Workflow

### 1. Interview User About Project Management

**Ask which tool is used:**

```
Which project management tool does this repository use?

1. JIRA
2. JIRA
3. GitHub Issues
4. None (manual tracking)
```

**Record response** for next steps.

### 2. Verify MCP Integration (If JIRA)

**For JIRA:**

Check if JIRA MCP server is available:

```bash
# Check for JIRA MCP tools
# Look for: mcp__atlassian__list_projects, mcp__atlassian__get_issue, etc.
```

**If JIRA MCP tools NOT available:**

```
The JIRA MCP server is not installed.

plugin requires the JIRA MCP server to work with JIRA issues.

**Installation Instructions:**
1. Visit: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/linear
2. Follow installation instructions for your system
3. Configure with your JIRA API key
4. Restart Claude Desktop/CLI

After installation, run this setup command again.
```

**Stop workflow** - cannot proceed without MCP server.

**If JIRA MCP tools ARE available:**

Proceed to authentication verification.

**For JIRA:**

Similar process:

- Check for JIRA MCP tools
- If not available → provide installation instructions and stop
- If available → proceed to authentication

**For GitHub Issues:**

No MCP server needed. Use `gh` CLI:

```bash
# Verify gh is installed and authenticated
gh auth status
```

If not authenticated:

```bash
gh auth login
```

### 3. Test Authentication

**For JIRA:**

Try listing projects to verify authentication:

```bash
# Use JIRA MCP tool to list projects
# Example: mcp__atlassian__list_projects
```

**Expected success:** Returns list of projects/teams

**If authentication fails:**

```
JIRA MCP authentication failed.

Please verify:
1. Your JIRA API key is correctly configured
2. The API key has necessary permissions
3. Your JIRA account has access to projects

Check your MCP configuration file and restart Claude.
```

**Stop workflow** - cannot proceed without valid authentication.

**For JIRA:**

Try listing projects:

```bash
# Use JIRA MCP tool to list projects
```

Handle authentication failures similarly.

**For GitHub Issues:**

```bash
# Verify gh authentication
gh auth status

# Test API access
gh repo view --json name
```

### 4. Ask for Project/Epic Information

**If JIRA:**

Ask user:

```
What is the top-level project, team, or epic for this repository?

This will be used as the default parent when creating new issues.

For JIRA: Provide team name or project ID
For JIRA: Provide project key (e.g., PROJ) or epic ID
```

**Validate the provided ID:**

For JIRA:

```bash
# Try to fetch the project/team by ID
# Confirm it exists and is accessible
```

For JIRA:

```bash
# Try to fetch the project or epic
# Confirm it exists and is accessible
```

**If validation fails:**

```
Could not find project/epic: [provided-id]

Please verify:
1. The ID is correct
2. You have access to this project/epic
3. The project/epic exists in your workspace
```

Ask for corrected ID or allow user to skip.

**If GitHub Issues:**

Record repository name (auto-detected from git remote):

```bash
# Get repository from git remote
git remote get-url origin
# Extract: owner/repo
```

### 5. Record Configuration in Documentation

**Update top-level CLAUDE.md** with project management metadata.

**If CLAUDE.md exists:**

Add or update the project management section:

```markdown
## Project Management

**Tool:** [JIRA/GitHub Issues]
**Project/Epic:** [project-id or name]
**Workspace:** [if applicable]

**plugin Integration:**
- MCP Server: [✓ Verified / ✗ Not installed]
- Authentication: [✓ Verified / ✗ Failed]
- Auto ticket creation: [Enabled/Disabled]
```

**If CLAUDE.md does NOT exist:**

Inform user:

```
CLAUDE.md does not exist yet. Project management configuration will be added when documentation is generated.

For now, I'll record:
- Tool: [JIRA/GitHub Issues]
- Project: [project-id]
- Status: MCP verified and authenticated ✓
```

Store this temporarily for later documentation generation.

### 6. Final Verification

**Run one more connectivity test:**

For JIRA:

```bash
# Try to create a test comment or fetch issue
# Confirm write access (if needed for the plugin workflows)
```

For JIRA:

```bash
# Test write access if needed
```

For GitHub Issues:

```bash
# Verify can list and create issues
gh issue list --limit 1
```

**If verification succeeds:**

```
✓ Project management configured successfully

Tool: [JIRA/GitHub Issues]
Project/Epic: [name/id]
MCP Status: Verified and authenticated
```

Proceed to next phase of setup.

**If verification fails:**

Show error and ask user to resolve before continuing.

## Expected Output

**Successful completion:**

- Project management tool identified
- MCP server verified (if JIRA)
- Authentication confirmed working
- Project/epic ID recorded
- CLAUDE.md updated (or info stored for later)
- Connectivity verified

**Summary to provide:**

```markdown
# Project Management Configuration Complete

**Tool:** [JIRA/GitHub Issues/None]
**Project/Epic:** [project-id or name]
**MCP Integration:** [✓ Verified / N/A]
**Authentication:** [✓ Verified / N/A]

## Available plugin Workflows

With project management configured, you can now use:
- `/refine` - Create/refine specifications
- `/plan` - Add technical plans to issues
- `/breakdown` - Create sub-issues with dependencies
- `/execute` - Auto-execute ticket workflows

## Next Steps

1. Generate repository documentation (if not done)
2. Create or refine your first issue
3. Use plugin workflows for automated development
```

## Error Handling

**MCP server not installed:**

- Provide clear installation instructions
- Link to official MCP server repository
- Stop workflow gracefully
- Instruct user to re-run setup after installation

**Authentication fails:**

- Explain what authentication is needed
- Provide troubleshooting steps
- Link to MCP configuration documentation
- Allow user to fix and retry

**Project/epic not found:**

- Verify user has access
- Check for typos in ID
- Offer to list available projects (if MCP supports it)
- Allow user to skip and configure manually later

**Write access issues:**

- Confirm API key has write permissions
- Check user's role in project/epic
- Provide instructions to update permissions
- Allow read-only mode if write not needed

## Notes

**MCP Server Responsibility:**

- plugin does NOT install MCP servers
- Users install MCP servers separately
- This skill only verifies installation and authentication

**Integration with Other Skills:**

- Called from `setup` command Phase 1
- Configuration used by: `refining-issues`, `breakdown-planning`, `executing-plans`, `creating-tickets`

**Configuration Persistence:**

- Stored in top-level CLAUDE.md (primary)
- Can also store in `.devkit/config.json` if needed
- Should survive documentation regeneration

**Future Enhancements:**

- Support for additional PM tools (Asana, Monday, etc.)
- Multiple project tracking (monorepos with different projects)
- Team-specific configurations
